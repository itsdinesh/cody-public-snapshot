## What is Cody?

Cody is an open-source AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses advanced search to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your codebase at any scale, all from within your IDE. Cody works with the newest and best large language models, including the latest Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4o.

Cody is available for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai), [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-cody-ai-by-sourcegraph), and [on the web](https://sourcegraph.com/cody/chat).

See [cody.dev](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral) for more info.

## What can Cody do?

- **Chat:** Ask Cody questions about your codebase using your configured AI models
- **Autocomplete:** Single-line and multi-line code suggestions as you type
- **Inline Edit (Alt+K):** Fix or refactor code from anywhere in a file
- **Prompts:** Cody has quick, customizable prompts for common actions. Simply highlight a code snippet and run a prompt, like ‚ÄúDocument code,‚Äù ‚ÄúExplain code,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenerate Unit Tests.‚Äù
- **Custom Models:** Configure your own AI models with API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

## Model Configuration

**This community version requires you to configure your own AI models.** Add your models to VS Code settings:

### Option 1: VS Code Settings UI
1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`)
2. Search for `cody.dev.models`
3. Click "Edit in settings.json"

### Option 2: Direct settings.json
Add to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "cody.dev.models": [
    {
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "title": "GPT-4o",
      "apiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
      "apiEndpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    },
    {
      "provider": "anthropic", 
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      "title": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
      "apiKey": "your-anthropic-api-key",
      "apiEndpoint": "https://api.anthropic.com"
    },
    {
      "provider": "google",
      "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
      "title": "Google Gemini 2.5 Flash", 
      "apiKey": "your-google-api-key",
      "apiEndpoint": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options:
- `provider`: Model provider (openai, anthropic, google, etc.)
- `model`: Model identifier 
- `title`: Display name in the UI (optional, defaults to model ID)
- `apiKey`: Your API key for the provider
- `apiEndpoint`: API endpoint URL
- `inputTokens`: Max input tokens (optional)
- `outputTokens`: Max output tokens (optional)

### Getting API Keys:
- **OpenAI**: [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic**: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Google**: [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

> [!TIP]
> If no models are configured, a default Claude 3.5 Sonnet model will be available (but won't work without proper API access).

## Demo

Cody comes with a variety of AI-for-coding features, such as autocomplete, chat, Smart Apply, generating unit tests, and more.
